# HW01CodeRefactor
Homework 1 for my CSC bootcamp course at UNC

My motivation for finding new information is learning more about how to use semantic code structures. I built this project for the same reason as my motivation, I had primarily wanted to learn more about structures for coding. The problem that was solved with this assignment was messy code and not using semantic design.

What I learned while doing this was how to convert multiple different classes into one single one, how to change already existing code into more refined code, how to successfully host something on github without instruction or help, and how to comment better on code.

I dont think there is anything this time that makes my project stand out, but next time I want to try harder to make it more apparent that I want to learn more.
